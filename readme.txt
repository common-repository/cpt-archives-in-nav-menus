This is now in WordPress core as of 4.4. Adds an archive checkbox to the nav menu meta box for Custom Post Types that support archives.

== Installation ==

1. Upload to your plugins folder, usually `wp-content/plugins/`
1. Activate the plugin on the plugin screen.

== Screenshots ==

1. Checking "All Sponsors" or "All Videos" and then the Add to Menu button will add the archives page to your menu.  The actual "All ____" label comes from the all_items label specified when the CPT is created, so yours may be different.
